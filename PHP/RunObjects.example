# Hi, today's lesson is going to be on PHP Objects

# - More specifically what is a PHP Object, and how can it be used?

# Everything is an object in the sense that it can be assigned to a variable or passed as an argument to a function. 
# So, attributes like Strings are objects, All methods have a built-in attribute __doc__ making them objects as well. 

# In this lesson we will cover:

# - What is an attribute?

# - What is a constructor?

# - What is a method?

# - What is a modifier?

# - What is encapsulation?

# Let's get started:

# - Here is a visual that will help with the Object concept, and it's possible related nouns

# - A shoe can have a sole

# - A shoe can have laces

# - A shoe can be for running / relaxation

class Shoe {
    private $color;
    public $hasLaces;
    protected $isForRunning;

    // CONSTRUCTOR
    public function __construct($color) {
        $this->color = $color;
    }

    // METHODS
    public function setColor($color) {
        $this->color = $color;
    }

    public function setIsForRnning($isForRunning) {
        $this->isForRunning = $isForRunning;
    }

    public function __toString() : string {
        return sprintf(
            "Shoe Color: %s \nLaces: %s \nRunning:  %s \n",
            $this->color,
            $this->hasLaces,
            $this->isForRunning
        );
    }
}

class Sneaker extends Shoe {
    
    // ATTRIBUTES THAT CAN NOT BE ACCESSED
    // private $color;

    // ATTRIBUTES THAT CAN BE ACCESSED
    // public $hasLaces;
    // protected $isForRunning;

    // CONSTRUCTOR
    public function __construct($color) {
        $this->setColor($color);
        $this->isForRunning = true;
    }
}

    print("");
    print("Hello Live Lessons");
    print("");

    $shoe1 = new Shoe("red");
    $shoe1->has_laces = true;
    $shoe1->set_color("green");
    print($shoe1);

    $shoe2 = new Shoe("blue");
    $shoe2->set_for_running(true);
    print($shoe2);

    $sneaker1 = new Sneaker("yellow");
    $sneaker1->has_laces = true;
    print($sneaker1);
